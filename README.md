## Overview
This project focuses on building a neural network to Binary Classification. It uses **[libraries/frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras]** to train and evaluate the model.

## Features
- A fully connected feed-forward neural network.
- Support for [e.g., classification, regression] tasks.
- Customizable model architecture and hyperparameters.
- Training and evaluation on Churn_Modelling Dataset
## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
  ```

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Churn_Modelling
- **Source**: Kaggle

## Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of:
- Input Layer: Accepts 12 features.
- Hidden Layers: Two layers with relu.
- Output Layer: One neurons with Sigmoid.
- Loss Function: binary_crossentropy.
- Optimizer: Adam.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: 81%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 80%

## Future Work
- Improve the model by [e.g., adding regularization, tuning hyperparameters].
- Experiment with different architectures.
- Extend the project to support [e.g., other datasets, real-time prediction].
